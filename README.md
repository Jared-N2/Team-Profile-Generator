# Team-Profile-Generator
the purpose of this was to create a team profile generator that generates different employees and their role. We needed to make classes for each employee and write functions that take in the data and print them to an html file. unfortunately I couldn't get mine working and I tried reaching out to BCS and get help during office hours, but no luck. 

## What I did
I started by creating all my classes because I felt that was easiest. then I started doing my tests. I got my test for employee working at one point and came back to it a day later to it failing. I tried everything to fix it and I dont know what happened to it. I also hopped on multiple zoom calls to try and get it working with classmates, but still get errors. Here is What I have so far and hopefully you can help me with what im doing wrong.
